## Finance Performance Dashboard 

Hello Everyone, 

I made this Finance Dashboard in Tableau with the Finance Excel Workbook provided by Unified Mentor.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this Tableau Dashboard is to analyze the financial performance of a company using the provided Unified Mentor.

To create a visually appealing dashboard that provides an overview of the company's financial metrics enabling stakeholders to make informed business decisions.

- Report data can be sliced by Segments, Country and Year to show particular data.

- Report has cards showing Total Units Sold, Total Gross Sale and Total Profit.

- Report are showed in Different Charts Bar chart,Scatter Plot,Line Graph and HeatMap.

-  It has a Bar Chart with Country on X-Axis and Sales on Y-Axis.

-  It has a Line Graph with Sales on X-Axis and Profit on Y-Axis.
